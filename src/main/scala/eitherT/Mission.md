Here at for-yield industries we like to write chains of instructions to complete our tasks.

We have one such task now:
- transform a json
- look up the user's email from their user id
- send an email to tell them their job has completed
- update the job status and persist in the database

then it's time to sit back and relax -OR-
you could try doing it a different way

Compare your result to one from our devs [here](https://github.com/daniel-manning/monad-transformers-exercises/tree/await)
